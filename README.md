# Copilot demo
Just wanted to create a demo copilot app that uses RDS so I could learn more :) 

## How to set up the demo
To run this demo simply follow the set of commands below

- `copilot init` - Select a load balanced web service, enter the name book-store, set docker file to `Dockerfile` and set the port to 8080. You can go ahead and deploy a test environment üëç
- `copilot deploy` - If you make any changes then you can deploy with this command
